## Overview

This project sets up a preconfigured Jenkins instance with JCasC and Job DSL.  
It contains a `Tools` folder in Jenkins with **2 jobs**:

- `clone-repository`: Allows you to clone a Git repository by simply providing its URL
- `SEED`: Dynamically generates a Jenkins job from a GitHub repository (e.g. `me/my-project`).   
The created job:
  - Uses the repository as a Git source
  - Runs a sequence of `make` commands (`fclean`, `make`, `tests_run`, `clean`)
  - Automatically updates itself via an SCM trigger every minute

This project is designed for developers or DevOps teams looking to quickly automate Jenkins configuration and job deployment.
